Timeouts: a child process can execute indefinitely, which prevents further
messages being sent. Some sort of timeout on child processes seems
appropriate, but what exactly? Whatever limit one chooses, one can find an
argument that a child process will need "just a bit longer". Perhaps a
gradually increasing timeout? Or starting up multiple child processes?
